# Namespace Service

This is the Namespace service. It manages the lifecycle of namespaces where a namespace is the logical separation for a bunch of services which provides isolation etc. This means it extends beyond simply a kubernetes namespace, rather, it encompasses all of the resources that might be used within that namespace - storage, compute, etc.
