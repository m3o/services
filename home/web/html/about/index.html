                    </center>
		    <div>
  			<p><b>Micro</b> is a globally distributed technology company on a mission to 
			simplify the way we build, share and collaborate on services in the 
			Cloud and beyond with a <b>developer first focus</b> üë®‚Äçüíª.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>

			<p>The world is moving towards becoming entirely driven by technology.
			Every business must now embrace the idea of becoming a technology company. 
			Making this change is hard. Maintaining a competitive edge in this day and age is 
			becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

			<p>Our ability to deliver a service can grind to a halt as we try scale with existing 
			inefficient platforms, processes and structure. Decade old technology 
			companies have undergone these scaling pains and most have used the same methods 
			to overcome those challenges.</p>

			<p>With the emergence of the Cloud we've accelerated software delivery and unlocked 
			elasticity in infrastructure management through APIs but software development tools 
			have lagged behind.</p>
			
			<p>At Micro we think we've found the model for effectively leveraging the Cloud and 
			now want to share that with the world.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>Design</b></h4>

			<p>Microservices is a software design pattern which accelerates development by 
			breaking down services into smaller units of composition which can be worked on and delivered 
			independently.</p>

			<p>The concept of microservices is not new, it's the reimagining of service based development 
			as an approach more holistically aligned with the unix philosophy of creating small processes 
			that do one thing well, which can then be combined via their inputs and outputs.</p>

			<br>
			<h6>The philosophy of microservices:</h6>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Services are small</b> - fine-grained as a singular business purpose similar to unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well"</li><br>
			<li>The organization culture should <b>embrace automation</b> of deployment and testing. This eases the burden on management and operations</li><br>
			<li>The culture and design principles should <b>embrace failure and faults</b>, similar to anti-fragile systems.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We believe microservices development is the key driving force of innovation in companies like 
			Amazon, Google and Facebook today. And now we want to share that with you.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>Architecture</b></h4>

			<p>As companies scale growth in usage and adoption, technology and people within the company 
			become a blocker of innovation and progress. One example was the explosive growth of Twitter 
			which led to a number of issues in 2009 and the fail whale we'd all become so accustomed to.</p>

			<p>Microservices enabled Twitter to breakout the product into smaller services which teams 
			could work on and scale independently of each other. Each team became responsible for 
			the delivery of their particular service which others may come to use through common APIs.</p>

			</div>
			<br>
			<p>We've seen through first hand experience that microservice systems enable faster development cycles, 
			improved productivity and superior scalable systems.</p>

			<p>Let's talk about some of the benefits:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1. <b>Easier to scale development</b> - teams organise around different business requirements and manage their own services.</li>

			<li>2. <b>Easier to understand</b> - microservices are much smaller, usually 1000 LOC or less.

			<li>3. <b>Easier to deploy new versions of services frequently</b> - services can be deployed, scaled and managed independently.</li>

			<li>4. <b>Improved fault tolerance and isolation</b> - separation of concerns minimises the impact of issues in one service from another.</li>

			<li>5. <b>Improved speed of execution</b> - teams deliver on business requirements faster by developing, deploying and managing microservices independently.</li>

			<li>6. <b>Reusable services and rapid prototyping</b> - the unix philosophy ingrained in microservices allow you to reuse existing services and 
			build entirely new functionality on top much quicker.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<h4><b>Technology</b></h4>

			<p>Micro is the simplest way to build microservices. We provide a <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">Runtime</a>
			 and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">Framework</a> for microservices 
			development. Enabling innovation in modern technology driven companies.</p>

			<p>We are the defacto standard for microservices development and will look to empower companies to leverage this technology 
			for their own businesses. From early stage prototyping all the way through to large scale production 
			deployments.</p>

			<p>Developers need to be given the tools to innovate and rapidly deliver services to
			end users without having to worry about infrastructure concerns. Micro is doing this through 
			the delivery of a serverless platform for microservices development.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>Execution</b></h4>

			<p>Our vision is to provide the fundamental building blocks for microservices so anyone can 
			develop and adopt them with ease. We want to empower not only the developers of today 
			but also unlock the next billion by providing a vastly simpler experience for service development.
			</p>

			<p>Software development is a largely exclusive demographic with only <b>~24m</b> of us in the world today. 
			What if we could change this. What if we could make it so that anyone could build services 
			as easily as they write text messages, make phone calls or post to instagram.</p>

			<p>We believe Micro is the best opportunity to realise that future.</p>
