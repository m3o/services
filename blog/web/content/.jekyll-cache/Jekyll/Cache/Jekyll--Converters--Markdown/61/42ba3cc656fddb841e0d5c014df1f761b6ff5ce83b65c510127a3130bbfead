In 2016, <code>go-micro</code>, a Go microservices framework was announced. Today we introduce the <code>micro server</code>, which builds on top of <code>go-micro</code>, and enables you to run and manage microservices with ease, both locally and across different environments. Whether you are running the <code>micro server</code> locally with zero dependencies (using memory or files), or on k8s (with highly available distributed systems and other third party tools), the <code>micro server</code> and the micro cli should provide a straightforward and runtime agnostic experience that is the same across any environment.</p>
