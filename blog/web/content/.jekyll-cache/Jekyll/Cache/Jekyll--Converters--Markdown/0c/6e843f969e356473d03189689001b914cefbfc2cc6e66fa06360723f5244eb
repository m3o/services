Over the past 4 years weâ€™ve focused on creating the simplest experience for microservice development. To do this 
we built a strongly opinionated open source framework called <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro"><strong>Go Micro</strong></a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/micro"><strong>Micro</strong></a>, a microservice toolkit built to explore, query and 
interact with those services via an API Gateway, CLI, Slack and Web Dashboard.</p>
