Today Iâ€™m excited to announce the <a href="https://micro.mu/explore/">Micro Explorer</a>, a single place to find projects within the micro ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-explorer">What is the Explorer?</h3>

<p>The Micro Explorer is primarily a search engine for micro related projects. GitHub has become the source of truth 
for the majority of developers and serves as a common place to share code, but itâ€™s not always easy to find exactly 
what youâ€™re looking for.</p>

<p>The Explorer gives us a way to do just that for all things Micro. Weâ€™re using the GitHub API to find any public repository 
that makes use of the micro libraries and putting them in a single convenient place for the community to explore and use.</p>

<p>Search is just the first feature of Explorer. Watch this space.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-an-explorer">Why do we need an Explorer?</h3>

<p>Time and time again questions appear in the community slack in regards to whether there are existing libraries, 
tools or services for specific micro related requirements.</p>

<p>Why build something when someone else may have already shared it with the world? Micro looks to promote sharing 
and reuse of plugins and microservices.</p>

<p>With that in mind, it became clear that even the simplest of aggregation tools to surface these repositories would 
be immensely useful.</p>

<p>As the community grows we hope to see more contributed back and made easily accessible through the Micro Explorer.</p>
