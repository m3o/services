I"/<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro"><strong>Micro</strong></a> is an open source project focused on simplifying microservices development. 
It started life as <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro"><strong>go-micro</strong></a> - a Go framework for microservice development. But even 
before then, go-micro, was a hacked up tiny library created to enable the development of a “kubernetes as a service” 
project way back when in 2014 (see the first commit <a href="https://gist.github.com/asim/a035820aec2d8cba5d73b5be12c6e707">here</a>).</p>
