By now you may have heard of this new phenomenon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices"><strong>microservices</strong></a>. 
If you’re not yet familiar and interested in learning more, checkout our introductory post 
<a href="/blog/2016/03/17/introduction.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this blog post we’re going to discuss <b><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">Micro</a></b>, an open source microservices toolkit. 
Micro provides the core requirements for building and managing microservices. It consists of a set of libraries and tools 
which are primarily geared towards development in the programming language <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, however looks to 
solve for other languages via HTTP using a <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/car">Sidecar</a>.</p>

<p>Before we get to the details of Micro, let’s talk about why we decided to dedicate our time to it.</p>

<h5 id="development-or-deployment">Development or Deployment</h5>

<p>It’s clear from our past experiences and what we’re seeing in the industry that there’s a need for a focus on development 
rather than deployment. PaaS solutions are readily available. Companies like AWS, Google and Microsoft 
are providing feature rich platforms while also rapidly moving towards supporting container orchestration if not already 
doing so. All of this gives us access to large scale compute with the click of a few buttons.</p>

<p>This new world sounds great. You might say this solves all your problems, right? Well, while we now have access to 
massive scale computing power, we’re still lacking the tools that enable us to write software that’s 
capable of leveraging it. Not only that, in this new world, containers are likely more ephemeral, coming and going 
as the runtime reschedules them or machines they’re running on fail.</p>

<h5 id="scaling-challenges">Scaling challenges</h5>

<p>The other issue we’ve seen time and time again is the way in which organisations fall victim to their monolithic 
architectures. With a need to grow at a blistering pace, there’s the tendency to cram features into the 
existing system and incur technical debt which snowballs into an unmanageable situation. Aside from this, 
as the organisation attempts to grow the engineering team, it becomes infinitely more difficult for developers 
to collaborate on a single code base or do feature development in parallel without being blocked at time 
of release.</p>

<p>There’s an inevitable need to rearchitect and an eventual path to SOA or microservice based 
architectures. Companies end up taking on an R&amp;D effort in house, learning by trial and error. If only 
there were tools to help create scalable systems, reduce the likely hood of R&amp;D and provide domain expertise 
from those with past experience.</p>

<h5 id="enter-micro">Enter Micro</h5>

<p>At Micro we’re building a microservice ecosystem that includes tools, services and solutions for microservice 
development. We’re building the foundation of that ecosystem with a tool by the same name. 
<b><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">Micro</a></b> is a microservice toolkit, which will enable the creation of a 
scalable architectures and increase speed of execution.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into the features of Micro.</p>

<h6 id="go-micro">Go Micro</h6>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro"><strong>Go Micro</strong></a> is a pluggable RPC framework used to build microservices in Go. 
It delivers the essential features required to create, discover and communicate with services. The core of any good 
microservice architecture begins by addressing service discovery, synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>

<p>Included packages and features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registry - Client side service discovery</li>
  <li>Transport - Synchronous communication</li>
  <li>Broker - Asynchronous comunication</li>
  <li>Selector - Node filtering and load balancing</li>
  <li>Codec - Message encoding/decoding</li>
  <li>Server - RPC server building on the above</li>
  <li>Client - RPC client building on the above</li>
</ul>

<p>Where Go Micro differs from most libraries is it’s pluggable architecture. This allows the implementation and backend 
system for every package to be swapped out. For example; the default service discovery mechanism for the registry is 
<a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a> but this can easily be swapped with a plugin for etcd, zookeeper or anything else 
you choose to implement. Plugins we’re implementing can be found at <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-plugins">github.com/micro/go-plugins</a>.</p>

<p>The value in a pluggable system is the ability to choose the platform used to support your microservices without 
having to rewrite any code. Go Micro requires zero code changes, just a mere import of a plugin and you’re done.</p>

<p>Go Micro is the starting point for writing microservices. The <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro"><strong>readme</strong></a> provides 
an overview of how to write, run and query a service. There’s a greeter example here <a href="https://github.com/micro/examples/tree/master/greeter">micro/examples/greeter</a> 
and more example services throughout the repo <a href="https://github.com/micro">github.com/micro</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> go micro</a></p>

<h6 id="sidecar">Sidecar</h6>

<p>So Go Micro provides a way to write services in Go but how about other languages? How do we create a polygot ecosystem 
where anyone can leverage the advantages of Micro? While Micro is written in Go, we wanted to allow a quicky and easy 
way to integrate applications written in any language.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/car"><strong>Sidecar</strong></a>, a lightweight companion service which is 
conceptually “attached” to the main (aka Parent) application and complements it by providing the features of the 
Micro system that are otherwise available using the Go Micro library. The sidecar is a process that runs alongside 
your application, delivering the features of Go Micro via a HTTP interface.</p>

<p>Features of the sidecar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registration with discovery system</li>
  <li>Host discovery of other services</li>
  <li>Healthchecking of the main application</li>
  <li>A proxy to make RPC requests</li>
  <li>PubSub via WebSockets</li>
</ul>

<p />

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/sidecar.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>Examples of using the Sidecar with ruby or python can be found here <a href="https://github.com/micro/examples/tree/master/greeter">micro/examples/greeter</a>. 
We’ll look to add more sample code in the near future to help with understanding how to integrate the sidecar.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/car"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> sidecar</a></p>

<h6 id="api">API</h6>

<p>Making RPC requests from one service to another is pretty straight forward with Go Micro but not ideal for external 
access. Instances of a service can fail, they may be rescheduled elsewhere or end up binding to any random port. 
The <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/api"><strong>API</strong></a> provides a single entry point to query microservices 
and should be used as the gateway for external access.</p>

<p>The API provides a few different types of request handlers.</p>

<h6 id="1-rpc">1. /rpc</h6>

<p>Individual services can be queried via RPC using the /rpc endpoint. Example:</p>

<pre><code>curl \
	-d "service=go.micro.srv.greeter" \
	-d "method=Say.Hello" \
	-d "request={\"name\": \"John\"}" \
	http://localhost:8080/rpc

{"msg":"Hello John"}
</code></pre>

<p />

<h6 id="2-apirequest">2. api.Request</h6>

<p>The API can be used to breakdown URLs to be served by individual microservices. This is a powerful method of API composition. 
Here the API uses the first part of the request path along with a namespace component to determine 
the service to route requests to. HTTP requests are then converted to an <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/blob/master/api/proto/api.proto">api.Request</a> 
and forwarded appropriately.</p>

<p>At Micro we use a pattern of creating API microservices to serve requests at the edge. Separating 
the responsibility of backend versus frontend services.</p>

<p>An example of API request handling:</p>

<p>Request</p>

<pre><code>GET /greeter/say/hello?name=John
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre><code>service: go.micro.api.greeter (default namespace go.micro.api is applied)
method: Say.Hello
request {
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/greeter/say/hello",
	"get": {
		"name": "John"
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The structure of an api.Request and api.Response:</p>

<pre><code>syntax = "proto3";

message Pair {
	optional string key = 1;
	repeated string values = 2;
}

message Request {
	optional string method = 1;   // GET, POST, etc
	optional string path = 2;     // e.g /greeter/say/hello
	map&lt;string, Pair&gt; header = 3; 
	map&lt;string, Pair&gt; get = 4;    // The URI query params
	map&lt;string, Pair&gt; post = 5;   // The post body params
	optional string body = 6;     // raw request body; if not application/x-www-form-urlencoded
}

message Response {
	optional int32 statusCode = 1;
	map&lt;string, Pair&gt; header = 2;
	optional string body = 3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>An example of how to create an API service can be found here. <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/blob/master/examples/greeter/api/api.go">Greeter API</a></p>

<h6 id="3-proxy">3. proxy</h6>

<p>The final method of request handling for the API is a reverse proxy. Just as above, the API uses the request 
path and a namespace component to determine the service to route requests to. By providing reverse proxying 
and microservice request routing we’re able to support REST, a widely sought after requirement.</p>

<p>The proxy can be enabling by passing the <code>--api_handler=proxy</code> flag.</p>

<p>An example of how to build a RESTful API can be found here <a href="https://github.com/micro/examples/tree/master/greeter/api/rest">micro/examples/greeter/api</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/api"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> api</a></p>

<h6 id="web-ui">Web UI</h6>

<p>The web UI provides a simple dashboard for observing and interacting with a running system. Not only that but it also 
provides a reverse proxy much like the API. Our goal with a “web proxy” is to enable the development of 
web apps as microservices. Again, just like the API, the request path is used along with a namespace to determine 
the service to route requests to. The web proxy also supports web sockets as we see realtime being a core part 
of delivering web apps.</p>

<p />

<p><a href="/blog/assets/images/web.png">
  <img src="/blog/assets/images/web.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0;" />
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/web"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> web</a></p>

<h6 id="cli">CLI</h6>

<p>The CLI is a command line tool which provides a way to observe, interact and manage services in a running environment. 
The current feature set allows you to inspect the registry, check basic health of services and execute queries against 
services themselves.</p>

<p />

<p><a href="/blog/assets/images/cli.png">
  <img src="/blog/assets/images/cli.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0;" />
</a></p>

<p>The other nifty feature, is the ability to use the Sidecar as a proxy for the CLI. It’s as simple as specifying 
the address for the sidecar as a flag <code>--proxy_address=example.proxy.com</code> when executing the CLI.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/cli"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> cli</a></p>

<h5 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h5>

<p>We’ve written an example of full end-to-end flow through the system using a simple greeter service.</p>

<p>The flow is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>HTTP GET request is made to the micro API at path /greeter/say/hello with the query name=John.</li>
  <li>The API translates this using the default namespace to the api service go.micro.api.greeter and method Say.Hello. 
The request is structured as an api.Request.</li>
  <li>The API using Go Micro, queries the registry to find all the nodes for the service go.micro.api.greeter and 
forwards the request to one of the nodes.</li>
  <li>The greeter api parses the request, generates a hello.Request and makes a request to the rpc service go.micro.srv.greeter. 
Again the same registry/discovery mechanism is used to find the nodes for the service.</li>
  <li>The greeter rpc service responds with a hello.Response.</li>
  <li>The greeter api translates the response into a api.Response and passes it back to the API.</li>
  <li>The micro API parses the response and responds to the client’s HTTP request.</li>
</ol>

<p />

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/greeter.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 0; height: auto;" /></p>

<p>In a more complex example, an API service may call out to many other RPC services, aggregate and transform 
the data and then pass back a final summarised result to the client. This allows you to maintain a 
consistent external entry point and change services in the background without the knowledge of the client.</p>

<h5 id="demo">Demo</h5>

<p>If you want to kick the tyres on a running system, checkout our demo at <a href="http://web.micro.pm">web.micro.pm</a>.</p>

<p>We’re running Micro On Kubernetes using Google Container Engine. The demo is open source if you want to run it yourself. 
You can find the k8s config here <a href="https://github.com/micro/kubernetes">github.com/micro/kubernetes</a>.</p>

<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>

<p>Micro provides the fundamental building blocks for writing and managing microservices. Go Micro includes 
the core requirements; discovery, client/server and pub/sub. The CLI let’s you interact with your 
environment and services. The sidecar enables integration of any non Micro application. The API is a 
single entry point for rpc requests and enables the creation of REST endpoints. With pluggable interfaces 
you can pick and choose the systems you want to leverage in building your architecture.</p>

<p>Our goal at Micro is to enable development at scale, increase speed of execution and provide value starting from 
the very beginning of the developer lifecycle. We feel Micro is the best way to do all those things.
Over time the ecosystem of tools will grow to include more feature rich services for discovery, routing 
and obversability.</p>
