Hey, weâ€™re starting a newsletter! Micro provides an opinionated view on how to build cloud-native systems but we want to provide 
opinions beyond the micro ecosystem too.</p>

<p><a href="https://micro.mu/#newsletter">The micro newsletter</a> is an opinionated summary of all things cloud-native. Every so often weâ€™ll send out an email with a few 
links to the most interesting cloud-native related content. This may include news, articles, videos, etc.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll also share some of our opinions on each piece of content so you can through the noise and get some concise thoughts 
to help you understand whatâ€™s going on.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve already sent out two newsletters and the response has been very positive so far. While we started with the idea of a weekly newsletter, 
weâ€™ll likely only send you content when thereâ€™s something interesting to talk about.</p>
