Today weâ€™re announcing support for Connect-Native Go Micro services via a slim initialisation library called <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-proxy">Go Proxy</a>. 
This will provide <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">Go Micro</a> with the ability to do authorized and secure service-to-service communication.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-consul-connect">What is Consul Connect?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/index.html">Consul Connect</a> is a feature of <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> which provides 
service-to-service authorization and encryption via mutual TLS. Consul Connect uses <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFEE</a> compliant 
certificates for identity.</p>

<p>We believe Consul Connect is a powerful mechanism for securing micro services. So how do we integrate?</p>

<h2 id="connect-native">Connect-Native</h2>

<p>Consul <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/native.html">Connect-Native</a> is native integration with the Connect API. This allows 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">Go Micro</a> services to become secure by default.</p>

<p>Consul Connect provides the ability to use proxies for communication but this can add overhead, Go Micro handles distributed 
systems concerns as a client library, which eliminates this overhead. Native integration with Connect gives us all its benefits 
while maintaining direct point to point connections for performance.</p>

<p>The consul documentation provides an overview of how this works. In Go Microâ€™s case we initialise a consul registry with the 
connect option enabled and setup the broker and transport tls config.</p>

<h2 id="using-connect-native">Using Connect-Native</h2>

<p>Weâ€™ve provided a complete example of how to get started in the <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-proxy">Go Proxy</a> repository.</p>

<p>But essentially itâ€™s a two line change. Import the connect package and create a new service with it. Thatâ€™s it!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Connect-Native gives us support for authorization and secure end to end communication for Go Micro apps without the overhead 
of proxies. Itâ€™s a great addition for micro users and we highly recommend using it.</p>
